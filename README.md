# 🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis | Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis of traffic accident data to identify patterns related to **road conditions**, **weather**, and **time of day**. The analysis aims to uncover accident hotspots and the key factors contributing to accidents. The dataset used is the **US Accident Dataset** from Kaggle.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **Prodigy_DS_05_Traffic_Accident_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing data cleaning, feature engineering, and accident hotspot visualizations.
- **data/**: Folder containing the traffic accident dataset.
- **prodigy_DS_05__Traffic_Accident_Analysis.pdf**: PDF report summarizing the findings and visualizations.

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Accident Hotspots**: Urban areas, especially near major intersections and highways, had the highest accident frequency.
2. **Weather Conditions**: Rainy and foggy weather significantly increased the likelihood of accidents.
3. **Time of Day**: Accidents were most frequent during **rush hours**, indicating that traffic congestion contributes to a higher number of incidents.
